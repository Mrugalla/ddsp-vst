title: "Dark Mode"

---

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
My eyes hurt when using bright plugins at night. Dark mode solves that.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A button (or other feature) that inverts all colours and saves this state, so that new plugin instances also generally get instantiated with dark mode.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Making the plugin interface smaller.

**Additional context**
